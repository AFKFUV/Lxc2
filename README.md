# GC-spammer

adding people too fast gets you ratelimited now, so bascily the spammer is useless/patched

My discord group chat creator,
choose a token or multiple tokens,
add a target user, (The user must be friends with the selected tokens)
afterwards it will start making and inviting the selected user to the groups.
a suggested use of this is getting lots of GC's on a singular account and inviteing a user to all of them (gc spamming)
